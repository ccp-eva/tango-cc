        <h3>Study Setup</h3>

        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-question">
            Which study components can I customize?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You can select the language of the audio instructions, the webcam
              recording, the number of trials, the study background, and the
              displayed agents.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What is the default selection?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The default settings refer to the settings we used in our cross-cultural gaze understanding study. 
              The default settings always present one trial of training 1, two trials of training 2, and 16 test trials. 
              Please note that the first trial of each kind plays voice-over instructions.
              The default background is a white wall with a window. 
              The default agents depend on the selected language and match what we chose in our cross-cultural gaze understanding study (see XXX citation). 
            </p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="faq-question">
            In the language selection, what does the option "custom" mean?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We added this language selection to offer you even more flexibility. 
              If you work with an offline version of the TANGO-CC and have downloaded the dist folder, 
              you can exchange the audio recordings in the folder "sounds > custom" with whatever mp3 files you want. 
              The only requirement is that it matches the naming of the placeholder mp3s within the "custom" folder.
              If you then start the live server and open the task, select language: custom and the task will play your own mp3s!  
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Why are the written instructions only in English?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No matter which language you choose, the written text instructions will always be in English. 
              Only the audio recordings change according to your language selection. 
              This design choice has four main reasons: 
              (1) we wanted to keep things manageable!
              (2) the text instructions are only meant for the experimentors, leading the participants (e.g., children who cannot read) through the study. 
              (3) the content of the text instructions is kept to the bare minimum. It is rather meant as a chance to pause between the different trial types.
              (4) some of the cultures in which we conducted our cross-cultural study (see Further reading) do not rely on written text that much / at all.

          <div class="faq-question">
            How did you guide children through the study?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              When we collected child data for our study, a study leader guided the children through the study. Here are the guidelines we used for our data collection: </p>
              <ul>
                <li> In short: don't give directions, don't point to any box/place, no direct right/wrong as feedback. </li>
                <li>
                  Briefly tell the children something like "Look, there are some children and balloons in the picture. We're about to play with them! A voice always explains to us what is about to happen. Let's listen to it together!" 
                </li>
                <li>
                  Between the trial types (i.e. whenever there is a text slide in between), you can say something like: "Great! We'll continue playing in a moment. The game changes a bit and the voice will explain it again. Come on, let's listen to it together!”
                </li>
                <li>
                  To direct attention back, "Look what's happening!" / "Well, where is the balloon?" / "Look at that animal there" etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In between, e.g. to motivate the children, you can always say "Super" / "great" / etc. between trials. Don't praise the response of the children directly, but the participation/attention overall. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  When kids ask where to click, say something like "Where's the balloon?" / "Show me where the balloon is". 
                </li>
                <li>
                  When children ask if they should click in a certain place / if it's right: “Press where you think the balloon is" / “Whatever you think" etc. No direct feedback, please! Feel free to praise the children in general, but don't tell them if it was right or not
                </li>
              </ul> 
          </div>

          <h3>Data collection & security</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What happens to the data?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              First of all: we do not use cookies or upload any data to our servers. 
              The data that is collected during the study (e.g., click coordinates, randomization, webcam video) will be downloaded to your device 
              and is fully deleted from the browser once you close your browser window.
              This means we cannot access any of the data that you/your participants enter. 
            </p>
            <p>
              After you/your participant finished the last trial, a CSV file will be downloaded to your device. 
              If you also selected the webcam recording, a WEBM file will also be downloaded to your device. 
              The files will be stored in your Downloads folder (or the path you personally specified in your browser settings). 
              The file name follows the pattern: "tangoCC-participantID-YYYY-MM-DD_hh_mm_ss". 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            How does the data look like, which variables will be saved? 
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you selected a webcam recording, you will be able to watch a WEBM file. 
              You can, for example, open this file in any browser. 
              The CSV file contains the following variables: 
            </p>

              <ul>
                <li> <strong> id: </strong> the participant ID you entered </li>
                <li> <strong> language: </strong> a shortcut for the selected language  </li>
                <li> <strong> bg: </strong> number of the background  </li>
                <li> <strong> trialNr: </strong> counting variable which trial </li>
                <li> <strong> trialType: </strong> touch, fam, test </li>
                <li> <strong> voiceover: </strong> true or false, were audio instructions played in this trial? </li>
                <li> <strong> agent: </strong> which agent was shown in the trial </li>
                <li> <strong> target: </strong> color of the balloon  </li>
                <li> <strong> bin: </strong> which rough area of the screen, (1 very left, 10 very right) </li>
                <li> <strong> targetCenterX: </strong> coordinate (between 0 very left and 1920 very right) </li>
                <li> <strong> clickX: </strong> coordinate where the participant clicked (between 0 very left and 1920 very right) </li>
                <li> <strong> absoluteClickDistance: </strong> absolute distance between targetCenterX and clickX </li>
                <li> <strong> timestamp: </strong> when did the trial end, UTC time </li>
                <li> <strong> responsetime: </strong> how long did it take from the end of the animation until the participant clicked (in ms) </li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <h3>Technical requirements and setup</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Does TANGO have any screen size or resolution requirements when run on tablet devices?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The task does not require a certain screen size. 
              It even runs on smartphones. However, we would recommend a bigger screen for better handling and touch precision. 
              What you do need is either a working internet connection or installing a live server. 
              Intel-based tablets might be easier to set this up. 
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Can I let the study run offline?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
              Yes, you can! The basic logic for an offline data collection is as follows: 
            </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  A live server opens the website. The name “live” server is a bit confusing. It is not actually live in the sense of “online”. It just means that it can host a website locally, so that you do not need to upload the website content somewhere else. This way, you do not need WIFI connection. You can just open this “live server” on your local device. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  The live server then displays the website by running the content of our so-called “dist” folder. This folder stores all the audio files, script etc. that the website needs. We have this folder ready for use, you can download it from the
                    <a href="https://github.com/ccp-eva/tango-cc/tree/main/dist" target="_blank">TANGO-CC GitHub page</a>
                  . 
                </li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            How can I set up a live server?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
                <li>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download" target="_blank">Node.js</a> on your device.</li>
                <li>Install the Live server: <br> # npm i -g live-server</li>
                <li>Navigate into the "dist" folder (cd command in the console) and open the index.html with the live server.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            How can I set up a live server on Android?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>First you have to install termux (a linux emulator) on your android device: <a href="https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk" target="_blank"></a> Link to Termux</li>
                <li>After opening this console you have to update the linux packages: <br>
                  # apt update  <br>
                  # apt upgrade
                </li>
                <li> In the console, activate the access to your device folders: <br> # termux-setup-storage</li>
                <li>
                  Install TANGO-CC related things: <br> 
                    # pkg install nodejs <br>
                    # npm i -g live-server
                </li>
                <li> With the command <br> # live-server <br> the browser should start on page 127.0.0.1:8080. Then your system is prepared </li>
                <li>Now you can put the dist folder somewhere an the android device e.g., storage/downloads/dist</li>
                <li>In tremux console you navigate into the distfolder <br>
                  # cd ~/storage/downloads/dist <br>
                  and start the server <br>
                  # live-server <br>
                  Now the experiment should run in browser.</li>  
              </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            For the offline version of the study, can I create a shortcut on my desktop?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, of course! Please first make sure that you enabled the live server (see questions above). 
              If everything works as expected, make a cmd shortcut on the desktop that looks like this (example for Microsoft Surface Pro device):
              %windir%\system32\cmd.exe /k live-server. In the shortcut settings, enter the correct pathway to the "dist" folder.

            What can I do if the website is not working?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p> For the online version: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Clean the cache of your browser and reload the website.</li>
                <li>Check your privacy settings and allow permissions to record via the webcam and download files.</li>
                <li>Please note that Safari has issues with webcam recordings. Try another browser!</li>
              </ul>
            <p> For the offline version: </p> 
              <ul>
                <li>Please make sure your device has a live server installed. Please open the index.html file with this live server! </li>
                <li>For Android, check that the termux app has rights for accessing files and media on your device. Check that you navigated into the right folder (using the cd command in the console).
