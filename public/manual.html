        <h3>Study Customization</h3>

        <div class="faq-container">
          <div class="faq-question">
            Which study components can I customize?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You can select the language of the audio instructions, the webcam
              recording, the number of trials, the study background, and the
              displayed agents. The study always shows an agent looking out of a
              window. In front of them, there is a balloon (red, yellow, green
              or blue) that falls to the ground. Depending on the trial type,
              the balloon flight will be visible or (partially) covered by a
              hedge.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">What is the default selection?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The default settings refer to the settings we used in our
              cross-cultural gaze understanding study. The default settings
              always present one trial of training 1, two trials of training 2,
              and 16 test trials. Please note that the first trial of each kind
              plays voice-over instructions. The default background is a white
              wall with a window. The default agents depend on the selected
              language and match what we chose in our cross-cultural gaze
              understanding study (see XXX citation).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            In the language selection, what does the option "custom" mean?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We added this language selection to offer you even more
              flexibility. If you work with an offline version of the TANGO-CC
              and have downloaded the dist folder, you can exchange the audio
              recordings in the folder "sounds &gt custom" with whatever mp3
              files you want. The only requirement is that it matches the naming
              of the placeholder mp3s within the "custom" folder. If you then
              start the live server and open the task, select language: custom
              and the task will play your own mp3s!

          <div class="faq-question">
            What values can I enter for the number of trials?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              You can enter any number between 1 and 100. Please note that the
              first trial of each kind plays voice-over instructions, so you
              will probably want to exclude the first trial of each kind from
              your analysis.

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you want to add other features to the TANGO-CC, you can do so
              by editing the code. Please visit our public GitHub repository:
              <a href="https://github.com/ccp-eva/tango-cc"
                >https://github.com/ccp-eva/tango-cc</a
              >. Clone the repo to your personal device (git clone
              git@github.com:ccp-eva/tango-cc.git) and start experimenting!
              Please note that we cannot offer individual coding counselling or
              website hosting for your own version of the task. We developed
              this task on macOS and use features for Unix-like operating
              systems (e.g., rsync). If you are working on a Windows device, you
              might need to adjust some of the code.

          <h3>Study Design</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What is the difference between the trial types?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The training trials are meant to familiarize the participants with
              the task. The first training trial shows a balloon that falls from
              the center to a random position on the ground. The participant is
              asked to click on the visible balloon. The second training trial
              shows a balloon that again falls to a random position on the
              ground, but this time the end position of the balloon is covered
              by a hedge. The participant sees the direction of the balloon
              flight, but not the exact end position. They are then asked to
              click on hedge, where they think the hidden balloon is. In the
              test trials, the balloon falls to a random location on the ground,
              while the whole balloon flight is covered by the hedge. The test
              trials are probably the ones that you will want to analyze.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Can I skip a study phase (e.g., training 1)?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, you cannot. Each study phase is necessary to understand the
              task and needs to be completed before the next phase starts.
              Please note that the first trial of each kind plays voice-over
              instructions.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Which components of the study will be randomized?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The order of the agents, balloon colors (red, yellow, green,
              blue), and balloon positions are each randomized independently.
              For the balloon positions, the full width of the screen (1920 in
              "SVG unit") is divided into ten bins. Exact coordinates (value
              between 0 far left and 1920 far right) within each bin are then
              randomly generated. The number of repetitions for each agent,
              balloon color, and balloon bin is calculated based on the total
              number of trials and the number of unique agents, balloon colors,
              and bins, respectively. All agents, balloon colors, and bins
              appear equally often and are not repeated in more than two
              consecutive trials. If the total number of trials is not divisible
              by the number of unique elements, additional elements are randomly
              selected to make up for the remainder. This ensures a balanced and
              random distribution of agents, balloon colors, and bins across
              trials. The randomized elements and their positions are logged for
              each trial, providing a detailed record of the experimental
              conditions.

          <div class="faq-question">
            Why are the written instructions only in English?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No matter which language you choose, the written text instructions
              will always be in English. Only the audio recordings change
              according to your language selection. This design choice has four
              main reasons: (1) we wanted to keep things manageable! (2) the
              text instructions are only meant for the experimentors, leading
              the participants (e.g., children who cannot read) through the
              study. (3) the content of the text instructions is kept to the
              bare minimum. It is rather meant as a chance to pause between the
              different trial types. (4) some of the cultures in which we
              conducted our cross-cultural study (see Further reading) do not
              rely on written text that much / at all.

          <div class="faq-question">
            How did you guide children through the study?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              When we collected child data for our study, a study leader guided
              the children through the study. Here are the guidelines we used
              for our data collection:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                In short: don't give directions, don't point to any box/place,
                no direct right/wrong as feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                Briefly tell the children something like "Look, there are some
                children and balloons in the picture. We're about to play with
                them! A voice always explains to us what is about to happen.
                Let's listen to it together!"
              </li>
              <li>
                Between the trial types (i.e. whenever there is a text slide in
                between), you can say something like: "Great! We'll continue
                playing in a moment. The game changes a bit and the voice will
                explain it again. Come on, let's listen to it together!”
              </li>
              <li>
                To direct attention back, "Look what's happening!" / "Well,
                where is the balloon?" / "Look at that animal there" etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                In between, e.g. to motivate the children, you can always say
                "Super" / "great" / etc. between trials. Don't praise the
                response of the children directly, but the
                participation/attention overall.
              </li>
              <li>
                When kids ask where to click, say something like "Where's the
                balloon?" / "Show me where the balloon is".
              </li>
              <li>
                When children ask if they should click in a certain place / if
                it's right: “Press where you think the balloon is" / “Whatever
                you think" etc. No direct feedback, please! Feel free to praise
                the children in general, but don't tell them if it was right or
                not
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Are there any limitations on where and when the participant can
            click the screen?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, there are. The participants can only click the screen after
              the voice recording stopped playing. If they click before, nothing
              will happen. If they do not click within 5 seconds, the voice
              recording will remind them to please touch the screen. The
              participants can only click on the lower part of the screen. If
              they click on the upper part (e.g., on the person in the window),
              nothing will happen.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Do participants get feedback on their performance?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, participants see a small orange circle where they clicked and
              hear a short sound, but they do not get any feedback on whether
              their response was correct or not. We decided against feedback
              because we wanted to keep the trials in the task as comparable as
              possible.

            <p>
              In a recent study, we tested the reliability and internal
              consistency of the TANGO. We found that the task is able to
              capture individual differences between children and adults. High
              internal consistency and test-retest reliability estimates
              underline that the captured variation is systematic. You can read
              more about this in our paper: <br />

          <h3>Study Requirements</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Does TANGO have any screen size or resolution requirements?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The task does not require a certain screen size. It even runs on
              smartphones. However, we would recommend a bigger screen for
              better handling and touch precision. What you do need is either a
              working internet connection or installing a live server.
              Intel-based tablets might be easier to set this up.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, they do not. The task is designed to be intuitive and easy to
              understand. The only requirement is that the participants can see
              the screen and touch it. If you are working with children, you
              might want to read the section "How did you guide children through
              the study?". What might help is to explain to the participants
              that there will be a computer voice that guides them through the
              study and that they should pay attention to this instruction. You
              can also practice touching the tablet before you start the study.

            <p>
              We have collected data from children between 3 and 80 years of
              age. The task seems to be fun for most and easy to understand.
              What we noticed is that some of the very young children tend to
              click in the center of the screen. So if you gathered a similar
              experience, you're not alone!

          <div class="faq-question">What happens to the data?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              First of all: we do not use cookies or upload any data to our
              servers. The data that is collected during the study (e.g., click
              coordinates, randomization, webcam video) will be downloaded to
              your device and is fully deleted from the browser once you close
              your browser window. This means we cannot access any of the data
              that you/your participants enter.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you/your participant finished the last trial, a CSV file
              will be downloaded to your device. If you also selected the webcam
              recording, a WEBM file will also be downloaded to your device. The
              files will be stored in your Downloads folder (or the path you
              personally specified in your browser settings). The file name
              follows the pattern: "tangoCC-participantID-YYYY-MM-DD_hh_mm_ss".
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Technical Setup</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            How do you pass on the selected options to the study website?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              We use URL parameters to pass on the selected options to the study
              website. This means that the URL of the study website changes
              according to your selection. For example, if you enter the
              participant ID "test1234", the URL will change to
              "https://ccp-odc.eva.mpg.de/tango-cc/tango.html?ID=test1234
              [...]". Everything after the question mark is a URL parameter. The
              parameter "ID" is followed by the participant ID you entered
              (characters after the "=" sign). URL parameters are listed one
              after each other, separated by the "&" character. The study
              website then reads the URL and adjusts the study accordingly. This
              is also the reason why you can share the URL with others and they
              will see the same study setup as you (even though randomization
              will be different).

          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            Do I need to finish the study in order to download the data?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              The automatic download only gets triggered after all trials are
              completed. However, you can open the browser console and download
              the data manually at any point during the study. For this, you
              simply need to enter the command "downloadData()" in the console
              and press enter. The data will then be downloaded to your device.
              Some browsers might ask you to confirm the download. The trials
              which were not completed yet will contain some empty columns in
              the CSV. You can do the same with the webcam recording by entering
              "downloadWebm()" in the console.

          <div class="faq-question">Can I let the study run offline?</div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, you can! The basic logic for an offline data collection is as
              follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                A live server opens the website. The name “live” server is a bit
                confusing. It is not actually live in the sense of “online”. It
                just means that it can host a website locally, so that you do
                not need to upload the website content somewhere else. This way,
                you do not need WIFI connection. You can just open this “live
                server” on your local device.
              </li>
              <li>
                The live server then displays the website by running the content
                of our so-called “dist” folder. This folder stores all the audio
                files, script etc. that the website needs. We have this folder
                ready for use, you can download it from the

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                First you have to install termux (a linux emulator) on your
                android device:
                <a
                  href="https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk"
                  target="_blank"
                ></a>
                Link to Termux
              </li>
              <li>
                After opening this console you have to update the linux
                packages: <br />
                # apt update <br />
                # apt upgrade
              </li>
              <li>
                In the console, activate the access to your device folders:
                <br />
                # termux-setup-storage
              </li>
              <li>
                Install TANGO-CC related things: <br />
                # pkg install nodejs <br />
                # npm i -g live-server
              </li>
              <li>
                With the command <br />
                # live-server <br />
                the browser should start on page 127.0.0.1:8080. Then your
                system is prepared
              </li>
              <li>
                Now you can put the dist folder somewhere an the android device
                e.g., storage/downloads/dist
              </li>
              <li>
                In tremux console you navigate into the distfolder <br />
                # cd ~/storage/downloads/dist <br />
                and start the server <br />
                # live-server <br />
                Now the experiment should run in browser.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-question">
            For the offline version of the study, can I create a shortcut on my
            desktop?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes, of course! Please first make sure that you enabled the live
              server (see questions above). If everything works as expected,
              make a cmd shortcut on the desktop that looks like this (example
              for Microsoft Surface Pro device): %windir%\system32\cmd.exe /k
              live-server. In the shortcut settings, enter the correct pathway
              to the "dist" folder.

          <h3>Trouble Shooting</h3>

          <div class="faq-question">
            What if the device does not recognize the clicks / touch from
            children?
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Sometimes, the device is not sensitive enough to register the
              clicks. This is especially true for children who have a lighter
              touch. In this case, you can increase the sensitivity of your
              tablet device. For example, on a Microsoft Surface Pro, you can do
              this by going to the Windows settings, selecting "Devices", then
              "Pen &amp; Windows Ink", and then "Change the pen tip pressure
              sensitivity". You can also try to instruct the children to adjust
              their touch behavior: You might ask the children to adjust their
              strength or speed (clicking stronger and faster, for example).
              Sometimes it helps if they hold their finger the other way around
              (upside down) or press with their thumb.

              <li>
                In any case, it might be worthwile to try another browser or
                reload the page.

            </ul>
            <p>For the offline version:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Please make sure your device has a live server installed. Please
                open the index.html file with this live server!
              </li>
              <li>
                For Android, check that the termux app has rights for accessing
                files and media on your device. Check that you navigated into
                the right folder (using the cd command in the console).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you want to take a deep dive into the programming world, open
              up your browser's console and/or developer tools and see whether
              you get any error messages.
